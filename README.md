# OpenWeatherMapAPIWeb

Project working with the Open Weather Map API in a web setting. I only used HTML, JS, and Express. To run, download the project and install neccessary modules such as express, node-fetch, path, dotenv. In an env file, set up the enivronment variable for your api key. Start the server, input a city and country and it will display the selected weather data that I chose.
